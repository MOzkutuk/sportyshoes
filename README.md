it is a smalle-commerce prototype website. The features are being used in the project are:
* Spring MVC
* Hibernate core
* Spring,Hibernate and Bean validation
* JPA
* MySql
* Maven

* Hibernate ORM

The concept of the project is to create a e-commerce website selling sport shoes,
managing the transaction between the user and the product,developing an adminpanel to control the flow and maintaining a good ORM relationship.

An admin can search and manage the users who signed up to the website and yes it is mandatory to continue to shop,
adding,deleting and updating the products, creating a purchase report of users and being able to change it's passwords.
It is not possible to add another admin through website,need to add it manually on Sql platform.
